This object-oriented application will allow the user to create a pizza order. The user can choose carry-out or delivery types. The user can then choose a Specialty pizza or create a blank pizza to add to their order. After the order is confirmed, the user will be asked for information depending on carryout or delivery. The user input will be validated for blanks and special characters. Once input is validated, the user is then given an overview of the order. From here they can change the order or submit the order. Once submitted the user gets a receipt containing a breakdown of the entire order. The user can then start the program again from the carryout delivery form.
