# CGS3464_SBailey_SemesterProject_Ver3
This object-oriented vb.net application will allow the user(an order taker) to create a pizza order. The user can choose carry-out or delivery. The user can then choose from a specialty recipe or start with a blank pizza. When the user is done adding pizzas to their order, they will be asked for information depending on whether they chose carry-out(name) or delivery(name and address). The user input will be validated for blanks and special characters, if input incorrect user must add information again. Once input is valid, the user is then given an overview of the order. From here they can change the order or submit the order to the kitchen. Once submitted, the user gets a receipt containing a breakdown of the entire order. The user can then restart the program from the carry-out and delivery form.
